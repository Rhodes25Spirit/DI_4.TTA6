                    <strong>Moon Knight</strong> is a character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel
                    Comics.<br>
                    The son of a rabbi, Marc Spector served as a Force Recon Marine and briefly as a CIA operative
                    before becoming a
                    mercenary alongside his friend Jean-Paul "Frenchie" DuChamp. During a job in Sudan, Spector is
                    appalled when ruthless
                    fellow mercenary Raoul Bushman attacks and kills archeologist Dr. Alraune in front of the man's
                    daughter and colleague,
                    Marlene Alraune. After fighting Bushman and being left for dead, a mortally wounded Spector reaches
                    Alraune's recently
                    unearthed tomb and is placed before a statue of the Egyptian moon god Khonshu. Spector dies, then
                    suddenly revives,
                    fully healed. He claims Khonshu wants him to be the "moon's knight", the left "Fist of Khonshu",
                    redeeming his life of
                    violence by now protecting and avenging the innocent. While early stories imply Spector is merely
                    insane, it is later
                    revealed Khonshu is real, one of several entities from the Othervoid (a dimension outside normal
                    time and space) once
                    worshipped by ancient Earth people. On his return to the United States, Spector invests his
                    mercenary profits into
                    becoming the crimefighter "Moon Knight", aided by Frenchie and Marlene Alraune, who becomes his
                    lover and eventually the
                    mother of his daughter. Along with his costumed alter ego, he primarily uses three other identities
                    to gain information
                    from different social circles: billionaire businessman Steven Grant, taxicab driver Jake Lockley,
                    and suited detective
                    and police consultant Mr. Knight.
